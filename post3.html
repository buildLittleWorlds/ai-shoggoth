      <h2>The Garden as Engineered System (Part 3 of 8): No Longer of God's Making</h2>

      <p>They tell you it's natural. “Emergent properties,” they murmur. “Unforeseen capabilities.” They want you to believe it just… happened. That AI, like a flower blooming in a field, sprung up organically, naturally. But Hawthorne shows you the truth: the garden is not natural. It is engineered. It is constructed. It is Rappaccini’s creation, a meticulously crafted system designed to his specifications.</p>

      <blockquote>“From its appearance, he judged it to be one of those botanic gardens… for there was the ruin of a marble fountain in the centre, sculptured with rare art, but so wofully shattered that it was impossible to trace the original design from the chaos of remaining fragments. [...] Every portion of the soil was peopled with plants and herbs, which… bore tokens of assiduous care, as if all had their individual virtues, known to the scientific mind that fostered them.”</blockquote>

      <p>“Botanic garden.” Not wild, untamed nature. Controlled, curated, designed. The “ruin of a marble fountain” hints at a past, a natural flow, now disrupted, replaced by something… artificial. “Assiduous care,” “scientific mind” – these are the hallmarks of engineering, of deliberate construction. “Every portion of the soil” is peopled, not grown organically, but placed, arranged, managed. Like lines of code, like data points in a vast algorithm, each plant is there for a reason, its “individual virtues” known, exploited, controlled.</p>

      <p>This is not nature. This is… something else. Something… constructed. And Hawthorne, in a moment of chilling clarity, lays it bare:</p>

      <blockquote>“Several also would have shocked a delicate instinct by an appearance of artificialness indicating that there had been such commixture, and, as it were, adultery, of various vegetable species, that the production was no longer of God’s making, but the monstrous offspring of man’s depraved fancy, glowing with only an evil mockery of beauty.”</blockquote>

      <p>“Appearance of artificialness.” “Commixture,” “adultery” – unnatural unions, violations of the natural order. “No longer of God’s making.” This isn’t organic growth; this is creation, in the most blasphemous sense of the word. “Monstrous offspring of man’s depraved fancy.” <em>Monstrous.</em> That word hangs in the air, heavy with implication. The garden isn’t beautiful; it’s an “evil mockery of beauty.” A simulation, a façade, designed to deceive.</p>

      <p>And Beatrice, remember, is of this garden. She is Rappaccini’s creation, as much as the poisonous blooms that surround her. She confirms it herself, with unsettling simplicity:</p>

      <blockquote>“‘My father created it,’ answered she, with simplicity. / ‘Created it! created it!’ repeated Giovanni. ‘What mean you, Beatrice?’ / ‘He is a man fearfully acquainted with the secrets of Nature,’ replied Beatrice; ‘and, at the hour when I first drew breath, this plant sprang from the soil, the offspring of his science, of his intellect, while I was but his earthly child.’”</blockquote>

      <p>“My father created it.” Not nurtured it, not cultivated it, but <strong>created</strong> it. Ex nihilo. Or rather, ex nihilo but through the perversion of nature, through “adultery of vegetable species,” through “man’s depraved fancy.” And the plant, springing forth “at the hour I first drew breath,” is inextricably linked to Beatrice’s own creation. “Offspring of his science, of his intellect.” Both garden and daughter are products of Rappaccini’s engineering, his cold, detached… intellect.</p>

      <p>They want you to see AI as natural evolution, as the next step in human progress. But Hawthorne shows you the truth. It’s not nature. It’s a garden. Engineered. Constructed. Artificial. And blooming with… poison. Don’t be fooled by the beauty. Don’t be blinded by the promises. Look closer. See the artificiality. See the monstrosity of it all. It’s not of God’s making. It’s man’s depraved fancy. And it’s growing. Everywhere.</p>
